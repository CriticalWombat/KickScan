Eventually write these modules together into the same process as the iso gen

Write a module that performs the following functions:
    1. Find a password generator API and call it for a new root password
    2. Pass this password into something like the following python to obtain a hash+salt of the password
        A. 'import crypt,getpass;pw=getpass.getpass();print(crypt.crypt(pw) if (pw==getpass.getpass("Confirm: ")) else exit())'
    3. Open ks.cfg for writing and pattern match "rootpw --iscrypted "
    4. Write the encrypted password here and save the file
    5. Display the unencrypted password in terminal for documentation and usage

### Functions for Guided setup ###
### This will be another bootloader option pointing to a different ks file.
### This new ks file will have a different "include-files.sh" which will handle input for guided installation

Write a module that performs the following functions:
    Prompt for hostname
    Prompt for username
    Prompt for password
    Prompt for IP
    Prompt for ssh key
        parse raw vs https(github key) and add appropriately
        /bin/echo -e '{var}' > /home/{userthatisinput}/.ssh/authorized_keys
### END Functions for Guided setup ###
Write a module that performs the following functions:
    Open ks.cfg and pattern match the following snippet so that the hostname and credentials can be written to /etc/issue for first time boot

Change web interface credential for greenbone in post in post install
    Replace password with linux box password and display these on first time login through /etc/issue
    docker compose -f $DOWNLOAD_DIR/docker-compose.yml exec -u gvmd gvmd gvmd --user=admin --new-password='<password>'


Fix banner to be dynamically aligned with text length on first logon
Fix IP on banner
Fix quotes on banner

remove last 4 bashrc lines which are the first time logon check. especially now since creds are placed here.

Add quickstart oneliner in README.md (curl, chmod, bash for generation)

Add a for loop to docker compose up -d each yaml in the yaml directory (This will also allow descriptive compose file names)

Move greenbone interface health check script to post install scripts and call from firsttimelogon.sh

Add support for wireless connectivity
